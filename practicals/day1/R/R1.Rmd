This first `R` exercise serves as a means of getting to know `R`. If you have any questions about this exercise, [please contact me](mailto:G.Vink@uu.nl). 

Let's get started.

# No experience with `R`
If you have no experience with `R`, I can highly suggest that you follow [this quick course](https://www.gerkovink.com/prepR). In this course I have prepared three exercises that take you up to speed in scripting with `R` very quickly. These exercises are discussed in video-walkthroughs that you can also find on this course page. The course also details [how to install `R` and `RStudio`](https://www.gerkovink.com/prepR/).

# Some experience with `R`
If you have some experience with R, I suggest that you make [these exercises](someexperience.html). They more-or-less cover all necessary skills to follow any coding examples I will give you in this course. 

---

# Fluent in `R`
If you are experienced in `R`, feel free to skip the introduction exercises. Still if you feel that you have questions about my code later on, feel free to ask me.
