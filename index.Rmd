### In `bigML`

We use generic machine learning data sets in our exercises. The train of thought in the exercises therefore closely resembles parts of [this online training](http://training.bigml.com) by `bigML`. Some of you have access to this platform, already. With `bigML` you can simply apply and evaluate a selection of machine learning algorithms in a standardized framework. For this you do not need any coding experience. 

- [Exercise in `bigML`](practicals/day3/bigML/bigML_exercise.html). This is the JASP exercise mimicked in `bigML`, with K-Means clustering instead of KNN classification. 


# Meeting 4

### Exercise with ShinyMice
[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) does not yet allow for data imputation. To get a feeling about imputing and inspecting incomplete data with `mice` in `R` without having to know `R`, we have developed `ShinyMice`. With `ShinyMice`, users can generate, inspect and evaluate incomplete data imputations in the browser. I (Gerko) walk you through the possibilities and evaluations that `ShinyMice` offers.
