### This meeting
In this meeting, [dr. Peter Lugtig](https://www.peterlugtig.com)
will teach us about *Inference and Hypothesis Testing*. <br>

During and after the lecture there will be plenty of room for questions and discussion. To aid the understanding of this meeting's theory we have prepared a series of exercises for you. You can find all meeting materials in the column to the right. 

[**THIS IS THE MEETING LINK FOR THE FIRST MEETING**](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/meetup-join/19%3ameeting_ZDE5MGQyOTMtZDU2Ni00OTU4LWIyODItZjc4M2I4MzZiZjE0%40thread.v2/0?context=%7b%22Tid%22%3a%22d72758a0-a446-4e0f-a0aa-4bf95a4a10e7%22%2c%22Oid%22%3a%22cc7d7fcd-73aa-4668-936a-2ca38cace0f3%22%7d)

### Lecture slides
Please find the lecture slides and relevant materials below:

- Slides on [Inference and Hypothesis testing]()

### Exercises in JASP
[JASP](https://jasp-stats.org) is an open-source statistics processor aimed at provinding an easy to use intuitive interface for standard analysis procedures. If you have little experience with statistics and programming, we recommend following the exercises in JASP. 

- [JASP exercises for meeting 1]()

If you have questions about the exercises, please contact [Gerko Vink](mailto:G.Vink@uu.nl)

### Exercises in `R`
[`R`](https://www.r-project.org) is a free software environment that serves as the de facto standard for statistical computing and graphics. If you have experience with statistics and programming, we recommend following the exercises in `R`. 

- [R exercises for meeting 1]()

If you have questions about the exercises, please contact [Gerko Vink](mailto::G.Vink@uu.nl)

**Other useful links for the `R` exercises: **

- For those that are not yet familiar with `R`, Gerko Vink has developed [this course including video walkthroughs](https://www.gerkovink.com/prepR/#exercises) aimed at getting participants jump-started with scripting in `R`.
